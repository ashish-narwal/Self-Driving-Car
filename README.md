# Self-Driving-Car
Build a minimal version of self driving car. Here, we have a front camera view. This will transfer input to the computer. Then Deep Learning algorithm in computer predicts the steering angle to avoid all sorts of collisions. Predicting steering angle can be thought of as a regression problem. We will feed images to Convolutional Neural Network and the label will be the steering angle in that image. Model will learn the steering angle from the as per the turns in the image and will finally predicts steering angle for unknown images.
* Used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to map the raw pixels from a front-facing camera to the steering commands for a self-driving car. This powerful end-to-end approach means that with minimum training data from humans, the system learns to steer, with or without lane markings, on both local roads and highways. The system can also operate in areas with unclear visual guidance such as parking lots or unpaved roads.
* The system is trained to automatically learn the internal representations of necessary processing steps, such as detecting useful road features, with only the human steering angle as the training signal. We do not need to explicitly trained it to detect, for example, the outline of roads.
